  <Step title="Coin launch & Demo mode ">
    Let's introduce the **Quantum Flip Coin (QFLIP)** to the market and showcase a **demonstration version** of our thrilling and addictive flip game!

    We aim to prove the platform’s core concept : a quick, all-in poker flip that leverages transparent blockchain technology. Thus, you will be able to notice the game's fairness by running multiple flips and educate yourself to the concept of poker equity.

    By launching a limited, proof-of-concept protocol, we give the community a tangible preview of how the real-money version will operate and build early trust in both the token and the gaming mechanics. We intend to set the foundation for community growth and prepare the ecosystem for the more advanced features arriving in subsequent phases.

  <Step title="Official launch & Fidelity program implementation">
    Now, **Quantum Flip** goes live on mainnet, transitioning to the full-scale platform where real wagers can be placed. Alongside this debut, we are pleased to introduce our **Fidelity program** offering rewards and special perks (such as rakeback and new starting hands) to consistent users. We intend to provide a smooth onboarding experience for new players but also nurture our beloved and engaged community by rewarding dedication and play volume.

  <Step title="Introducing PvP mode & Multi-flip tournaments">
    At this stage, **Quantum Flip** evolves from a head-to-house setup into a **multi-player environment** by introducing **multi-flip tournaments** and **progressive jackpots**. Players can now compete against each other across multiple rounds, exploring tournament structures with larger prize pools. This expansion not only boosts player engagement through new strategic dimensions but also strengthens the overall community by offering varied and exciting routes to multiply your crypto-assets.

  <Step title="The first and ultimate Solana-based poker room">
    In this phase, **Quantum Flip** evolves into a full-fledged **Solana-based poker room**, capitalizing on Solana’s high throughput and low transaction fees for a seamless gaming experience. The platform expands beyond single-hand flips, introducing **short-handed cash games**, **Spin\&Go and MTTs**—all backed by transparent, on-chain fairness. By merging the speed and scalability of Solana with innovative gameplay, Quantum Flip positions itself as the **premier** destination for decentralized, crypto-powered poker.

  <Step title="Intergrating the first AI agent-powered GTO/MDA poker solver">
    At this point, **Quantum Flip** unlocks next-level gameplay by introducing **Quantum Solve,** a **Game Theory Optimal (GTO)/Mass-Data Analysis (MDA) solver** powered by **AI agents**. By incorporating AI-driven solutions, Quantum Flip not only elevates competitive play but also pioneers educational resources, helping users understand optimal decisions and enhance their overall poker experience while unfolding professional opportunities.&#x20;

    With this cutting-edge feature that will be available to our most consitsent users and supporters, we intend to build the strongest poker players community of all time and achieve the purest form of what a poker room should be.
